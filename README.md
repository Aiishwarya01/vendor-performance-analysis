# ðŸ§¾ Vendor Performance Analysis â€“ Retail Inventory & Sales

Analyzing vendor efficiency and profitability to support strategic purchasing and inventory decisions using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---
## Overview

This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

---
## Business Problems

Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:
- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
- Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
- Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
- Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability

---
## What I Did

- Cleaned and explored vendor data using **Pandas** 
- Visualized insights using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Wrote SQL queries to dig deeper into vendor performance
- Performed **hypothesis testing** to check if differences in vendor profitability are statistically significant
- Built a final **Power BI dashboard** to present key findings clearly

---
## Dashboard

- Power BI Dashboard shows:
  - Vendor-wise Sales and Margins
  - Inventory Turnover
  - Bulk Purchase Savings
  - Performance Heatmaps

---
## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- SQL 
- Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)
